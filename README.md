# elxrBB-tutorial

A (an ambitious) collaborative effort with ChatGPT (GPT-4) to create a tutorial, and open source, a form application

## What?

This repo is the result of a recent conversation with [ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/collections/3742473-chatgpt) ([GPT4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)). The clever little chatbot suggested in true ChatGPT Dunning-Kruger style, and I figured ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, okay, maybe we can build a real tutorial from this conversation

Essentially, I asked ChatGPT about how to build a forum web app using Elixir and Phoenix

## Why?

The conversation around ChatGPT right now is wild. There's a lot of [doomers](https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-experts-urge-pause-training-ai-systems-that-can-outperform-gpt-4-2023-03-29/) out there, [some moreso](https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/) than [others](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-as-much-of-a-doomer).

A [recent toot](https://hachyderm.io/@aburka/110098164435536382) on hachyderm.io seems to suggest another point of view:

This intance I'm working with keeps forgetting things, and I've spotted plenty of issues with its code as we've gone along so far

I harbor no illusions that this will be successful. I'm sure some, if not most, of its code is crap, maybe even already outdated

But there is something amazing about working with an always there (except when you hit the 25 message cap) knowledge partner that is omniscient (presenting). 

It's a hell of a "yes-man"

## How?

I am just working with ChatGPT to build both this tutorial and the application

I intend to opensource the final product (should one be built, I definitely harbor no illusions about my ability to focus on this, nor my skill level with Elixir, that it will actually get done)

I do hope some folks might [contribute]() in the future, maybe even some folks with actual Elixir experience will be willing to vet the project

Or maybe it will be another repo gathering dust :shrug:
