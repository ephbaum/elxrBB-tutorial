# Introduction to the Forum Application and System Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to the elxrBB forum application tutorial! In this series of lessons, we will guide you through the process of building a complete forum application called elxrBB using Elixir and the Phoenix Framework. This tutorial is designed for learners with basic programming knowledge but little to no experience in implementing full systems. By following this tutorial, you will not only learn how to build elxrBB from scratch but also understand important concepts and techniques related to web application development.

Alongside this tutorial, we will be building a reference app as an open-source solution that anyone can use as-is or as a starting point for their own customizations.

## elxrBB Features

Our elxrBB forum application will include a variety of features that are commonly found in online discussion platforms:

1. User authentication and registration with email verification.
2. Publicly accessible discussion threads organized by topics.
3. Threaded replies and support for subtopics.
4. Real-time updates for all clients via a pub/sub architecture.
5. Upvote and downvote functionality for topics.
6. User profiles with avatars, biographies, and preferred names.
7. Private messaging between users.
8. User roles and a subscription system for "pro users."
9. Media upload capabilities and support for different text formatting options (Markdown, BBCode, and WYSIWYG).
10. User audit trails and post management for moderators and administrators.
11. Notifications via email, browser notifications, and SMS/voice for pro users.

## System Components and Their Interactions

The elxrBB application will consist of the following main components:

1. Frontend: The user interface of the application, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Backend: The server-side logic, implemented in Elixir using the Phoenix Framework.
3. Database: A database system to store and manage the application's data, such as PostgreSQL.

These components will interact with each other to provide a seamless user experience:

- Users interact with the frontend, which sends requests to the backend for processing.
- The backend handles the requests, communicates with the database, and returns appropriate responses to the frontend.
- The frontend updates the user interface based on the responses received from the backend.

## Technologies and Frameworks Used

In this tutorial, we will use the following technologies and frameworks to build elxrBB:

1. Elixir: A functional, concurrent, and general-purpose programming language.
2. Phoenix Framework: A productive web framework for Elixir that enables high-performance and maintainable applications.
3. PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source, object-relational database system.
4. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The core technologies for building web pages and user interfaces.
5. LiveView: A Phoenix library for building real-time, interactive web applications without writing JavaScript.
6. [Additional libraries, tools, and services as needed throughout the tutorial]

By using these technologies and frameworks, we will be able to create a robust and scalable forum application, elxrBB, that meets the needs of modern web users.

In the upcoming lessons, we will dive deeper into each component and feature, guiding you through the process of building elxrBB from start to finish. Let's get started!
