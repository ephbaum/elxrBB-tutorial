# Lesson 6: Adding Private Messaging and User Profiles

In this lesson, we will be implementing private messaging between users, creating user profiles with biographies and preferred names, implementing an avatar system with file uploads, and configuring file storage with Digital Ocean Block Storage.

1. **Implementing private messaging between users**

To implement private messaging between users, create a new schema called `Message`. Add the following fields to the schema: `sender_id`, `recipient_id`, and `content`. The `sender_id` and `recipient_id` fields should be foreign keys referencing the `User` schema.

Create a new `MessageController` with the necessary CRUD actions to manage messages. In the views and templates, make sure only the sender and recipient can view the message content.

2. **Creating user profiles with biographies and preferred names**

To create user profiles, update the `User` schema by adding two new fields: `biography` and `preferred_name`. In the `Accounts` context, update the registration and update functions to accept these new fields.

Update the templates and views to display user profiles, including the `biography` and `preferred_name` fields.

3. **Implementing an avatar system with file uploads**

To implement an avatar system, you will need to add an `avatar` field to the `User` schema, which will store the filename of the uploaded avatar image.

Use a library like `arc` to handle file uploads. Follow the library's documentation to configure the upload settings and create an `AvatarUploader` module.

Update the user registration and update forms to include a file input for uploading avatar images. In the user profile view, display the avatar image if one is uploaded.

4. **Configuring file storage with Digital Ocean Block Storage**

To configure file storage with Digital Ocean Block Storage, you will first need to create a new Digital Ocean volume and attach it to your server. Follow Digital Ocean's documentation on how to do this.

Next, configure the `arc` library to use Digital Ocean Block Storage as the storage backend. Update the `AvatarUploader` module to use this storage backend.

Ensure that the uploaded avatar images are stored on the Digital Ocean volume and served correctly in the application.

With the completion of this lesson, you have successfully added private messaging and user profiles to your elxrBB application. Users can now send private messages to each other, create profiles with biographies and preferred names, and upload avatar images.
